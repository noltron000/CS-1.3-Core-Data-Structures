## Word Jumble Activity - (65 min)

This is a design challenge that will involve both individual and partner work.

### Description

Below is a word jumble from a newspaper:

**The challenge is to design a way to solve this word jumble with a computer!** Use what you've learned in class to make this!

Each jumble of letters is actually an anagram of a real word. Your job is to rearrange them to form a real English word.

Once you solve all 4 words, look at where the circles are. All of the letters within the circles should be added to a letter bank, which you'll unscramble and use to solve the final jumble, which is a hyphenated phrase.

### Tips/Hints

- Use the English dictionary words file located at `/usr/share/dict/words` on all Mac and Linux installations.
- You first need to solve all of the 4 jumbled words to find the set of letters used in the final jumbled phrase.
- The final jumbled phrase is more challenging to solve because it’s made up of multiple words, and it could even be a made-up word or phrase pun (see yesterday’s solution at the bottom of the image: “furrever”).

### Phases of the Activity

1. (Individual) Brainstorm ideas of data structures and algorithms you can use to solve this on your own whiteboard
1. (Pairs) Find a partner whom you don’t usually work with, collaborate, share and debate ideas for your solution
1. (Individual) Write *_pseudocode_* to design your solution first (on whiteboard or on your computer)
1. (Individual) Start implementing your solution with real code!

For the rest of class, your goal is to accomplish the following:

1. Find a partner
1. Write pseudocode
1. Begin writing some implementations for the first and second scenarios
